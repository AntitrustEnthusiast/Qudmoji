  "Description": "[h1]What?[/h1]\nReplaces various mod adjectives with colorful symbols for brevity. Similar to marks from Legendary Merchants, except questionably useful.\n\nOnly changes display names, actual descriptions (the \"Look\" action) should be unchanged so you can check names on the fly.\n\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\nCan be added or removed mid-run safely. Items will begin showing original adjectives after a restart without needing to regenerate them.\n\n[h1]Options[/h1]\nDisable any specific replacements in options. I'm sure some won't make sense to anyone but me, or show up too rarely to care. \n\nOptionally supports showing icons on items with proper names (disabled by default).\n\n[h1]Why?[/h1]\nWhile I absolutely love the complex adjective/naming/coloring system, it can get a bit ridiculous in endgame with a dozen Chimera limbs each holding an item with 3 mods [i]and[/i] an energy cell with its own 3 mods. Or a dozen recoilers with the same.\n\nThis mod seeks to improve that without breaking vanilla balance or removing (much) information.\n\n[h1]Why __ icon or __ color?[/h1]\nIn general, I tried to follow a few rules when picking from the symbols in [url=https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Modding:Code_page_437]code page 437[/url]:\n\n[list]\r\n    [*]If there's a single or predominant color for the original description, try to keep it\n    [*]Icon selection is based on either vanilla usage (piercing icon for sharp mod, etc.) or conceptual similarity (willowy is related to weight so use the # symbol, flaming/electrified/freezing are similar so use same icon, etc.)\n    [*]Don't just use letters\n[/list]\n\n[h3]License[/h3]\nThis is released under the MIT license.
